##Part 4: Final Report
##irections: Write a query that returns the following collumns:

##Pokemon Name	Trainer Name	Level	Primary Type	Secondary Type
##Pokemon's name	Trainer's name	Current Level	Primary Type Name	Secondary Type Name
##Sort the data by finding out which trainer has the strongest pokemon so that this will act as a ranking of
##strongest to weakest trainer. You may interpret strongest in whatever way you want,
##but you will have to explain your decision.

SELECT (maxhp + attack + defense + spatk + spdef + speed) AS TotalStat, p.name AS "Pokemon Name", t.trainername AS "Trainer Name", pt.pokelevel AS "Level", ptype.name AS "Primary Type", stype.name AS "Secondary Type"
FROM pokemons p JOIN pokemon_trainer pt ON p.id = pt.pokemon_id
JOIN trainers t ON pt.trainerID = t.trainerID
JOIN types ptype ON p.primary_type = ptype.id
JOIN types stype ON p.secondary_type = stype.id
ORDER BY TotalStat desc;


#I added the total offense stats and defense stats to get the overall strongest pokemon. I only chose stats that will
#affect how the pokemon battles one another.
