##Part 3: Joins and Groups
##Directions: Write a sql query or sql queries that can answer the following questions

#What is each pokemon's primary type?
SELECT t.name, p.name FROM types AS t JOIN pokemons AS p on t.id = p.primary_type;

#What is Rufflet's secondary type?
SELECT p.name, t.name FROM pokemons AS p JOIN types AS t ON p.secondary_type = t.id WHERE p.name = 'Rufflet';
#Flying

#What are the names of the pokemon that belong to the trainer with trainerID 303?
SELECT p.name from pokemons AS p INNER JOIN pokemon_trainer AS pt on p.id = pt.pokemon_id WHERE trainerID = 303;
#Wailord and Vileplume

#How many pokemon have a secondary type Poison
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pokemons WHERE secondary_type = 7;
#31 secondary type poison

#What are all the primary types and how many pokemon have that type?
SELECT t.name, COUNT(*) FROM types AS t JOIN pokemons AS p ON t.id = p.primary_type GROUP BY t.name;

#How many pokemon at level 100 does each trainer with at least one level 100 pokemone have? (Hint: your query should not display a trainer)
SELECT COUNT(pokemon_id) from pokemon_trainer WHERE pokelevel = 100 GROUP BY trainerID;
#194 pokemons


#How many pokemon only belong to one trainer and no other?
SELECT COUNT(pokemon_id), p.name from pokemon_trainer pt JOIN pokemons p ON pt.pokemon_id = p.id group by pt.pokemon_id HAVING COUNT(trainerID) = 1;
#5 pokemons
